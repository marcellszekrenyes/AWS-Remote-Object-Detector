This project is an AWS-based remote object detection application that leverages the power of serverless architecture and computer vision. The app allows users to upload images to an S3 Bucket, triggering an AWS Lambda function that processes the images using a YOLOv3-tiny model for object detection. The model is integrated into the Lambda function through a custom layer that includes OpenCV and NumPy for efficient image processing. Detection results are then stored in DynamoDB, and a summary of the detected objects is returned directly to the client via an HTTP response.
